 * <p>Returns the replication configuration of a bucket.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p> It can take a while to propagate the put or delete a replication configuration to
 *             all Amazon S3 systems. Therefore, a get request soon after put or delete can return a wrong
 *             result. </p>

 *          <p>If you include the <code>Filter</code> element in a replication configuration, you must
 *          also include the <code>DeleteMarkerReplication</code> and <code>Priority</code> elements.
 *          The response also returns those elements.</p>
