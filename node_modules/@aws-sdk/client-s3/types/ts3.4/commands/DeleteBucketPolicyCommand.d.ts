/**
 * <p>This implementation of the DELETE operation uses the policy subresource to delete the
 *          policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the
 *          AWS account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the
 *             <code>DeleteBucketPolicy</code> permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the
 *          bucket owner's account to use this operation. </p>
 *
 *          <p>If you don't have <code>DeleteBucketPolicy</code> permissions, Amazon S3 returns a <code>403
 *             Access Denied</code> error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an
 *          identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a <code>405 Method Not
 *             Allowed</code> error. </p>
 *
 *
 *          <important>
 *             <p>As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS account that owns a bucket can
 *             always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the
 *             ability to perform this action.</p>
 *          </important>
