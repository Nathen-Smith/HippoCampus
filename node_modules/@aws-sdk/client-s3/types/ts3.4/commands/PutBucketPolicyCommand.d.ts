/**
 * <p>Applies an Amazon S3 bucket policy to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you are using an identity other than
 *          the root user of the AWS account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the
 *             <code>PutBucketPolicy</code> permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the
 *          bucket owner's account in order to use this operation.</p>
 *
 *          <p>If you don't have <code>PutBucketPolicy</code> permissions, Amazon S3 returns a <code>403
 *             Access Denied</code> error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an
 *          identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a <code>405 Method Not
 *             Allowed</code> error.</p>
 *
 *          <important>
 *             <p> As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS account that owns a bucket can
 *             always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the
 *             ability to perform this action. </p>
 *          </important>
