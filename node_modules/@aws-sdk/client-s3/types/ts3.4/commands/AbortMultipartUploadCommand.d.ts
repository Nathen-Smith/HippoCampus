/**
 * <p>This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no
 *          additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any
 *          previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in
 *          progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary
 *          to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage
 *          consumed by all parts. </p>
 *          <p>To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged for the part
 *          storage, you should call the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html">ListParts</a> operation and ensure that
 *          the parts list is empty.</p>
