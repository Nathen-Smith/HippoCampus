/**
 * <p>Deletes a delivery stream and its data.</p>
 *          <p>To check the state of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>. You can delete a delivery stream only if it is in one of the following states:
 *             <code>ACTIVE</code>, <code>DELETING</code>, <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>, or
 *             <code>DELETING_FAILED</code>. You can't delete a delivery stream that is in the
 *             <code>CREATING</code> state. While the deletion request is in process, the delivery
 *          stream is in the <code>DELETING</code> state.</p>
 *          <p>While the delivery stream is in the <code>DELETING</code> state, the service might
 *          continue to accept records, but it doesn't make any guarantees with respect to delivering
 *          the data. Therefore, as a best practice, first stop any applications that are sending
 *          records before you delete a delivery stream.</p>
