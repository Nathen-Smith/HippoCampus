/**
 * <p>Creates an Amazon Rekognition stream processor that you can use to detect and recognize faces in a streaming video.</p>
 *         <p>Amazon Rekognition Video is a consumer of live video from Amazon Kinesis Video Streams. Amazon Rekognition Video sends analysis results to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.</p>
 *         <p>You provide as input a Kinesis video stream (<code>Input</code>) and a Kinesis data stream (<code>Output</code>) stream. You also specify the
 *             face recognition criteria in <code>Settings</code>. For example, the collection containing faces that you want to recognize.
 *             Use <code>Name</code> to assign an identifier for the stream processor. You use <code>Name</code>
 *             to manage the stream processor. For example, you can start processing the source video by calling <a>StartStreamProcessor</a> with
 *             the <code>Name</code> field. </p>
 *         <p>After you have finished analyzing a streaming video, use <a>StopStreamProcessor</a> to
 *         stop processing. You can delete the stream processor by calling <a>DeleteStreamProcessor</a>.</p>
